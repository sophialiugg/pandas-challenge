## Written Report
### Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

### Summary Analysis
Pandas dataframes were utilized to analyze data gathered from 15 schools across districts. The information from each school was merged to form a comprehensive dataset representing the entire district. This combined dataset was then summarized and organized based on various parameters such as school size, school type (district or charter), and school budget and per student spending. 

### Conclusions
1. Overall, charter schools demonstrate a notably higher rate of overall passing rate compared to district schools.
2. Charter schools allocate fewer resources/lower overall cost per student compared to district schools on average, yet they achieve higher average scores and a greater percentage of passing rates across all metrics.
